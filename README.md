# MPC_aircraft
Aircraft jet landing has been studied extensively for performing optimized and accurate maneuvers. These conditions are of great value for air-coast and navy defence where the runway is short and thus landing within a restricted set of conditions is required. Some scenario also require a constant height or keeping a constant distance from refuelling planes. The "MPC_aircraft_landing__updated.pdf" article, we attempt to pursue the problem of optimum control with MPC tools and attempt to highlight the differences obtained.
